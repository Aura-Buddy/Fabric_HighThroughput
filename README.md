These file include go scripts to parallize routines to allow for shorter runtimes
sequentialHighThroughputClient.go is the primary client used
experimentalFastConcurrency.go was the first attempt at adjusting the performance
experimentalHeat50.go was the most recent attempt to improve performance

PERFORMANCE
Time to complete decreases minutely and cpu utilization has a trend of reducing
with increasing parallelization
